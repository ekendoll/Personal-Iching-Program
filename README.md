Personal I-Ching/Yi-Jing Program
---
This program was created to be a basic tool for casting, saving and retrieving I-Ching readings. 

**Features**:
  - Full casting mechanics using the yarrow stalk changing line probabilities (1:3:5:7)
  - Read the Hexagram's judgement, image and changing lines from your casting.
  - Ability to save readings and retrieve saved readings.

**Future Features**:
  - A prettier and user-friendly TUI.
  - Option to read on hexagrams without having to make a cast.
  - Keyword based query to pull readings from the saved_hexagram file. 


*Note*:
- This program is super basic and partially unfinished. The retrieval function only has option 2 working at the moment. I will update and fix as soon as possible.
